<p>
<span className='font-bold text-gray-950'>At SBCODL</span>, we believe education is a transformative force that can overcome societal barriers. In India, over 59 million children are out of school, denied their fundamental right to learn due to socio-economic inequalities. Our mission, <span className='font-bold text-gray-950'>"Education for All"</span> goes beyond academic instructionâ€”we're committed to creating equitable opportunities for underprivileged students.
    </p>
<p>
<span className='font-bold text-gray-950'>Esatablished in 2022</span>, we've been actively working to bridge educational gaps by providing free learning materials, connecting schools with local communities, and supporting gifted students from disadvantaged backgrounds. We don't just see education as an academic pursuit, but as a powerful tool for social upliftment. By offering resources, support, and opportunities, we aim to empower children who might otherwise be left behind.
Our vision is to transform individual lives and, by extension, create a more just and inclusive society. Together, we can make education a universal right, not a privilege.
