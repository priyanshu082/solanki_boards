                Most education enthusiasts usually inquire about the constitutional acceptability and validity of SBCODL and what type of admissions or services are offered to students passing out from SBCODL.

                The straightforward answer to all these questions is that all educational boards and universities are independent institutions. It is up to a university whether or not to grant admission to a student from another university. In the same vein, it is the freedom of every State Government to choose whether or not to offer services to an individual who has graduated from a specific university or educational board.

                As far as the issue of recognition is concerned, SBCODL is among the top educational institutions in the nation.

                SBCODL has been formed under the compulsory and constitutional provisions of the Indian S.R. Act XXI-1860. SBCODL does not get any grant-in-aid from the Government or the UGC; hence, the UGC Act is not applicable to the council.

                The idea of distance education was first developed in Berlin, Germany, in 1856. Subsequently, Russia recognized distance education, and it became a global phenomenon. British Prime Minister Harold Wilson envisioned the idea of open universities in 1863 with the intention of offering educational services to those who otherwise were denied access. In 1969, an Open University was established in the UK under a Royal Charter, which was more successful than conventional universities.
