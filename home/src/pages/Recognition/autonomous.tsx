            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 ">
              Autonomous institutions have a vital role to play in the improvement of higher education by providing academic freedom, innovation, and self-regulation. The University Grants Commission (UGC) emphasizes the significance of autonomy in its XI Plan profile by expressing that institutions enjoying academic and operational freedom are more likely to excel and achieve greater credibility. Granting funds to such institutions also enhances their capability to undertake high-quality education and research.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-blue-200">Need for Autonomy</h2>
            <p className="mb-4 ">
              Academic institutions that have the possibility of excellence are usually constrained in providing advanced courses because of inflexible affiliating patterns. The Education Commission (1964-66) underlined the need for teachers' academic freedom because it helps to create an environment conducive to intellectual progress. Absence of such an environment makes it difficult to attain academic excellence.

            <p className="mb-4 bg-indigo-50 p-3 rounded-md text-indigo-800 border-l-4 border-indigo-500">
              Since students, teachers, and administrators are co-partners in the educational process, autonomy guarantees that they have a more active role to play in decision-making and curriculum formulation. Hence, the Education Commission (1964-66) suggested autonomy as a key instrument for inducing excellence in higher education.
