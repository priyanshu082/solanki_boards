            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The concept of distance education has its roots in Berlin, Germany, in 1856. Later, Russia granted recognition to distance education, marking a global shift in alternative learning methods. The idea of open universities was further developed by the British Prime Minister, Honourable Harold Wilson, in 1863.

              Honourable Harold Wilson was born in 1916 in Huddersfield and studied at Oxford University, where he was exposed to his tutor, G.D.H. Cole. He went on to become a lecturer in economics at Oxford and a member of the Labour Party, later being elected to the House of Commons in 1945.

              At the age of 29, Wilson was named Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Fuel and Power. Wilson's strong educational background and commitment to modernizing Britain made him victorious in the general election of 1964, gaining a five-seat majority in the House of Commons. His popularity continued to rise, and in the 1966 election, his majority rose to 97 seats.

              Wilson was twice elected Prime Minister of Britain and became the founder of the Open University. His vision of open education was firmly based in his socialist ideology, stressing its potential to create opportunities for students from disadvantaged groups.

                The principle of distance education is a good substitute for the conventional education system, which comes under mounting pressure with the increasing number of applicants. Every year, the need for higher education keeps on growing, and student intake in universities is going up at a mean rate of 7%.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Now there are over 30 universities conducting correspondence courses, thus spreading education to a greater population. The open education system allows individuals who cannot attend traditional institutions to study. It is especially helpful for students from remote locations, working professionals, and disadvantaged groups who need flexible schedules for learning.

                Open universities allow students to study at their own pace at their convenience without the strict adherence of attending traditional classroom sessions. On 5 August 1985, the Union Education Minister highlighted in the Rajya Sabha that the institution of open universities would bring with it a new era of educational technology.
